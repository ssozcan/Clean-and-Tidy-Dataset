# Description of the Tidy Data Set: ```tidydata.txt```
This code book describes the data, the variables, and the work that is performed to clean up the data

## The data
* There are 180 rows and 68 columns in the data set
* Each row represents the average per subject per activity of a variable
* First two columns are activity and subject. Remaining 66 columns are the selected measurements as described below.

## The work performed for cleaning the data
* Some variables were not unique. Those were made as unique via the ```make.names``` function
* In the variable names: The ```.```, ```-``` and ```,``` are subsituted with the ```_``` by using the ```gsub``` function 
* Activity lables are replaced with descriptive activity types using a ```for``` loop through all rows of the ```activity``` column 

## The variables
* The variables are a set of masurements consisting of either a mean or a standard deviation measurement selected from the main data set of 561 variables:
* activity  
* subject

* tBodyAcc_mean_Y
