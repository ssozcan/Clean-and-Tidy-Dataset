# Clean and Tidy Data Set

This repo is created for the final assignment of the Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data

## Data Description
* There are 2 data sets: 1-Train data, 2-Test data
* The data sets are outcome of an experiment held on 30 people(subjects) with 6 different activities: 1-WALKING, 2-WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
3-WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4-SITTING, 5-STANDING, 6-LAYING
* Each person performed the six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, experiment captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
* Total number of measurements is 561.

## What does the code (run_analysis.R) do?
* Merges the training and test data sets to create one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
* Descriptive activity names are produced in the data set
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Create a second data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject
